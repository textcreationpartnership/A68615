            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In effect, all theſe <hi>great men</hi> of the World did ſee buried every moment the hope of this vaine glory, whereof their ambition was alwayes labouring to make acquiſt; and yet not one of them for all this, ſtept backe; as if they tooke a pride in their vanities, and the folly of them were hereditary.<note place="margin">Ambition never elevates, but to give a greater fall.</note> 
               <hi>CAESAR</hi> had ſeene the death of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and with him all the glory of his renowne, and <hi>Pompey</hi> had ſeene buried in the tombe of <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Oblivion,</hi> the renowne of that great <hi>Scipio,</hi> whoſe valour more redoubted then the thunder had made the <hi>Earth</hi> tremble ſo oft. <hi>Scipio</hi> in his turne might have read the Epitaph, which deſpaire, ſhame, and diſaſter had graven in letters

Ambitious ſpirits, though you ſhould conquer a thouſand worlds, as hee did this one, you ſhould not be a whit rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for all theſe conqueſts. The <hi>Earth</hi> is ſtill as it was, it never changes nature. All her honours are not worth one teare of repentance: all its glory is not to bee prized with one ſigh of contrition. I grant that the noiſe of your renowne may reſound through the foure corners of the Univerſe: That of <hi>SALADINE</hi> which went round it all, could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt him from the miſhaps of life, nor miſeries of <hi>Death.</hi> After he had encof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all the riches of the Eaſt, yet findes he himſelfe ſo poore for all that, hardly can he take along with him ſo much as a <hi>Shirt.</hi>

               <hi>Death,</hi> you ſhall reſent the paines of an eternall regreet, having now no more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to repent you to any effect.</p>
            <p>Beleeve mee, all is but <hi>Vanity, Honour, Glory, Riches, Praiſe, Eſteeme, Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> All this is but ſmoake during Life, and after <hi>Death,</hi> nothing at all. The <hi>Grands</hi> of the world have made a little more noyſe then others by the way. But this Noyſe is ceas'd, their light is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh't, their memory buried. And if men ſpeake of them ſometimes, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is returned with a ſhake of the head, intimating no more words of them, ſince ſuch a Law of ſilence, <hi>Time</hi> hath impoſed hereon.

               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:15757:83"/>to learne to dye generouſly. What a glory's this to over-awe <hi>That,</hi> which commands the whole world? what Courage is this, to aſſaile and combate <hi>That,</hi> which none could ever yet reſiſt? and what a power is it to tame <hi>That</hi> which never yet yeelded? <hi>Echo</hi> her ſelfe hath not rebounds enow to reſound aloud the wonders of this <hi>Victorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not the Triumph of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> when he made his entry into <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> mounted upon a Chariot as rich as the <hi>Indies,</hi> and more gliſtering then the <hi>Sunne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this we ſee no other riches, but the rich contempt, which ought to be made of them; no other luſtre, but of <hi>Vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not the Triumph of <hi>Caeſar</hi> then, when he was drawne unto the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitoll</hi> by forty Elephants, after he had wonne twenty foure battels. In this we ſee nought elſe but a <hi>funerall</hi> pompe, but yet ſo glorious, that <hi>Death</hi> her ſelfe ſerves for a <hi>Trophie</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>This is not the Triumph of <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas,</hi> where the glorious luſtre of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:15757:83"/>magnificence ſham'd the ſplendour of the day, which yet lent its light to it. The marvels which appear'd in this here, ſeem'd as celebrating in blacke the Exequies of all the other brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the world, ſince nothing can be ſeene more admirable then this.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">To triumph over <hi>vice,</hi> is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt <hi>Trophie.</hi>
               </note>This is not the Triumph of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> where all the graces are led captive with <hi>Zenobia.</hi> In this are to be ſeene no other captives but the world, and all its vanities, and their defeat is the richeſt Crowne of the <hi>Victor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not the Triumph of that pompeous Queene of <hi>Egypt</hi> entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where ſhee rays'd admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her ſelfe in a Galley of unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable value, but in this wee contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the more then humane induſtrie of a Pilote, who from the mid'ſt of the ſtormes and tempeſts of the world, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers happily to the Port, the ſhip of his life, though yet but in the way to approach to it.</p>
            <p>In fine, this is not the Triumph of <hi>Seſostris,</hi> whoſe ſtately Chariot foure Kings drew. Paſſions are the onely ſlaves of this, and <hi>Death</hi> being here
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:15757:84"/>vanquiſht, this honour remaines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, and the name of the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> deſirous to expoſe to the view of day, all the magnificent preſents, which Fortune had given him in his laſt conqueſts, entred now the third time in Triumph into the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:15757:84"/>City of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the noyſe of his valour made as many Idolaters, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, gayning hearts, and now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering ſoules, as well as before Realms and Provinces: But it ſeemes, that the glory, which accompanyed him in this action had this defect, not to be ſufficiently worthily knowne, even of thoſe that were witneſſes of it, as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing by much, all that they could poſſibly expreſſe of it.</p>
            <p>There was ſeene advanc't before his Charriot, in oſtentation,<note place="margin">

There was admired in ſequell, a <hi>Statue</hi> of the Moone, all of Gold, in forme of a <hi>Creſcent,</hi> and I am aſtoniſht, that this Image of change and <hi>Viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> made him not fore-ſee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of the Wheele, I meane the

He caus'd moreover to be caried before him a great number of Veſſels of Gold, never thinking that <hi>Death</hi> might ſoone repleniſh ſome part of them with his aſhes. There was ſeene to follow a Mountaine all of Gold, upon which were all ſorts of animals, and many Trees of the ſame matter, and this mountaine was enrounded with a Vine, whoſe golden glittering dazled the eyes of all that conſidered its wonders.<note place="margin">

            <p>'Tis remark't in the life of the happy <hi>Francis Borgia,</hi> of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Jeſuites, that being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the world to ſeeke a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, although the greatneſſe of his birth, and merits, were of very great conſideration; the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth committed to his charge the dead body of his deare Spouſe, to be conducted and carryed to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of her anceſtours, which he vnder tooke, holding for an exceſſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the commandement which hee had received, and the particular choiſe which his Majeſtie had made of his perſon.
